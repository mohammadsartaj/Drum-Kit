**Drum Kit Website**
Welcome to the Drum Kit Website! This web application allows users to interact with a virtual drum kit, where each key on the keyboard is mapped to a drum sound. Users can play beats by pressing the corresponding keys, and also choose from a selection of playlists for automated playback.

Features
Interactive Drum Kit: Each key on your keyboard (from "A" to "L") is mapped to a different drum sound (kick, snare, hi-hat, etc.). Press the keys to play drum sounds.
Playlist Options: Users can select a pre-defined playlist to play the drum kit sounds automatically in a rhythm.
Two Modes:
Try Yourself Mode: Play the drum sounds manually by pressing the corresponding keys.
Play for Me Mode: Let the app automatically play the drum sounds in a selected rhythm or playlist.
Technologies Used
